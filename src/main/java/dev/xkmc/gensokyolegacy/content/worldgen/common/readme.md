# Random Access Infinite Maze Generation

## Definition

### Cell

A cell is a cubic space with a 3D position
(denoting the smallest values of each axis)
and an integer `scale`. The edge length of the cell is `2^scale`. The coordinates of the vertexes of the cell are
integer multiple of the edge length. All sub-cells of a cell should be interconnected through paths within the cell.

### Wall

A wall is a square area between 2 cells of the same scale. A wall has a 3D position
(denoting the smallest values of each axis), a normal vector, and a scale. A wall is open when one side can pass to the
other.

## Generation procedure

First start from a grid of cells with maximum scale. The largest cells have all walls open.

To access the state of a cell, the algorithm will traverse down from the top cell, and full determine the immediate
state of the cell and its walls. The immediate state of a cell includes the open-ness of the internal walls. The
immediate state of walls include the open-ness of its children.
